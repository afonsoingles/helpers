## Install it!

## Region locks
Some helpers are only available in some regions, and currenttly the only one implemented is Bus Alerts, and it is only available in Portugal. You will see in the gallery that there are no helpers available, unless you are in Portugal.

## AI Usage
The server had very few AI usage here and there. The app AI usage is written on its repo.
